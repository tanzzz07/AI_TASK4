 Logistic Regression

## 📌 Objective
Implement a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- File Used: `data.csv`

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned data by dropping unnecessary columns
- Encoded categorical target variable (`diagnosis`)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Scaled features using StandardScaler
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score
- Plotted ROC Curve for model performance visualization

## 💻 Code
The Python code was written in Jupyter Notebook and includes all steps from data loading to evaluation using scikit-learn and visualization libraries.

## 📊 Output
- Confusion Matrix and classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- ROC Curve plot
- ROC-AUC Score
